This is the Jekyll version of a theme called Clean Blog (details below) that began as the default for my blog for The Flatiron School/Learn.co, which required seven blog posts.
[The blog](https://bronwencc.github.io) itself focuses on Data Science topics and coding tutorials.

#### Changes to this template:
* I have changed the background image to one of my own creation for the About page.
* Added statement to [post.html](https://github.com/bronwencc/bronwencc.github.io/blob/master/_layouts/post.html) so a post shows "(Edited: date format)" in "Posted by" text when there is a page `updated` variable.
* I added a custom error page to show in case of a 404 error when navigating the site, as [404.html](https://github.com/bronwencc/bronwencc.github.io/blob/master/404.html).
